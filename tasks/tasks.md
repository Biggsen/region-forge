## 🚧 Missing Features & Improvements

### 🔥 High Priority

- [ ] **Map Upload Functionality (File Upload)**
  - [x] URL loading for map images ✅
  - [x] Map generation from seed ✅
  - [ ] Drag & drop file upload for local images (nice-to-have, not MVP requirement)
  - [ ] File validation (PNG, JPG format)
  - [ ] Display upload progress/loading state (for file uploads)
  - [ ] Handle upload errors gracefully (for file uploads)
  - **Note**: URL loading and seed generation cover all essential use cases. File upload depends on user accounts feature (see `spec/user-accounts-spec.md`).

### 📈 Medium Priority

- [ ] **Enhanced Drawing Tools**
  - [ ] Chunk snapping for precise region boundaries
  - [ ] Rectangle drawing tool
  - [ ] Circle drawing tool
  - [ ] Undo/redo functionality
  - [ ] Delete individual points while drawing

- [ ] **Improved UI/UX**
  - [x] Basic zoom controls ✅ (mouse wheel zoom, space+drag pan)
  - [x] Zoom to region ✅ (zoom to selected region bounds)
  - [ ] Zoom to fit (automatically fit map to canvas on load)
  - [ ] Mini-map for navigation
  - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
  - [x] Region search/filter in sidebar ✅
  - [ ] Bulk region operations (duplicate, merge)
  - [x] Bulk delete ✅ (delete all regions implemented)

### 🎨 Nice to Have

- [ ] **Advanced Features**
  - [ ] Region templates/presets
  - [ ] Region categories/tags
  - [ ] Region descriptions/notes
  - [ ] Region validation (check for overlapping regions)
  - [x] Region statistics (area calculation exists) ✅
  - [ ] Region perimeter calculation

- [ ] **Performance & Technical**

  - [x] Error handling ✅ (basic error handling implemented)
  - [ ] Comprehensive error handling across all operations
  - [ ] Optimize canvas rendering for large maps
  - [ ] Add unit tests
  - [ ] Add integration tests

- [ ] **User Experience**
  - [ ] Onboarding system (step-by-step guides, tutorials, tooltips) - **Post-MVP**
  - [ ] Keyboard navigation support
  - [ ] Screen reader compatibility
